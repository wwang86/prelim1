problem 1 is solely hand written. No code included. Saved in prelim1.pdf
Problem 2a uses ICT1.json. Please use problem2a.jl together with ICT1.json. cheme.png shows the result
Problem 3a is hand written in pdf. code for 3b is p3b.m The figure is saved at figure3b.fig

I don't really know how to do problem 2 b&c. I tried to list all the parameters needed in parameters.jl. I also tried to form an array showing the initial x but I don't really know how to get the updated x values after changing parameters. From my understading, to do the central difference analysis, we need to change parameters one at a time (using a matrix), using new x value minus original value and divide by 2 times the step size (dx/dp). To do this for a time interval, a for loop is probably needed.
